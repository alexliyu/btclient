BTClient
--------

Simple Bit Torrent client (command line),  that enables sequential download and then streams video to 
video player (via http or stdin, but stdin is not seekable), when got enough of the file content is available
to start playback. Also supports HTTP sources, when it can download video from several connections 
concurrently and then stream it to the player. Can work with file sharing services, if plugin is provided 
to resolve file link. 

```
usage: btclient.py [-h] [-d DIRECTORY] [-p {mplayer,vlc}] [--port PORT]
                   [--debug-log DEBUG_LOG] [--stdin] [--print-pieces]
                   [-s SUBTITLES] [--stream] [--no-resume] [-q]
                   [--delete-on-finish] [--clear-older CLEAR_OLDER]
                   [--bt-download-limit BT_DOWNLOAD_LIMIT]
                   [--bt-upload-limit BT_UPLOAD_LIMIT]
                   url

```

Accepts either torrent file path or magnet link or http(s) link to torrent file or http link to file.

From torrent file chooses the biggest video file, starts to download it  and sends it to video player 
(works with mplayer or vlc).

Can also download subtitles for current video file (option -s - uses opensubtitles.org API).

Requires libtorrent (1.0.4) and its python bindings,  gnome-terminal and hachoir python libraries.
Optionally  beautifulsoup and adecaptcha for plugins.
